# Solving EFGs

## Task
Task is to formalize a specific game into extensive form and then solve it. It is split into 2 parts, `game_tree.py` creates a game tree, and `game_lp.py` creates the linear program out of the tree structure to find Nash equilibria and solves it.

More specifics of the task are available in the [efg2021.pdf](efg2021.pdf) file.

## Tests
There are 5 different mazes in the examples folder, together with their values of the game.
